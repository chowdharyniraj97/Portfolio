          I am an aspiring software engineer/web developer who enjoys
          simplifying other's tasks by leveraging the power of technology and
          building tools that cuts down the user's time. A short example would
          be how I helped my mother and a friend recently - When my mother
          whined about being tired of attending calls for her consultancy, I
          built her a website. When my friend cribbed about him being
          disorganized, I built him a Todo App. Seeing others being grateful to
          you for demystifying their task, is a unique feeling that only a
          developer can understand and enjoy.
